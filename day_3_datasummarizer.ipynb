            "Ottawa’s $208-million outsourcing agreement with consulting firm Accenture Inc. to deliver the pandemic support program for businesses was a sole-source contract, the government has confirmed. The Irish-American company’s contract to administer the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) program was revealed by The Globe and Mail in February. After an access-to-information request , weeks of back-and-forth with the government and questions from parliamentarians in the House of Commons and the Senate, Ottawa has finally provided more details of the agreement.\n",
            "The government told The Globe it was a sole-source contract because Ottawa believed a formal procurement process would take too long.\n",
            "“When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the federal government acted swiftly to provide emergency support and ensure that Canadians and Canadian businesses could weather the storm,” said Katherine Cuplinskas, press secretary for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, in an e-mail.\n",
            "CEBA was the first and most widely used pandemic support for businesses. It was launched April 9, 2020, and provided partly forgivable loans of as much as $60,000 to almost 900,000 businesses. Some $49-billion in credit was extended to those enterprises through their financial institutions, and many entrepreneurs have credited the program with providing a crucial lifeline during the uncertainty of the first COVID-19 lockdowns.\n",
            "Ottawa originally assigned the program to Export Development Canada, a Crown corporation that provides credit to Canadian businesses doing work abroad. EDC was given the task because it is the steward of the Canada Account, a mechanism to lend money to businesses that EDC would otherwise deem too risky to support.\n",
            "But EDC said it did not have the internal capacity to operate a loan program of that scale, so it outsourced much of the implementation to Accenture.\n",
            "The Finance Department told The Globe EDC chose Accenture to deliver CEBA because the two had worked together before. EDC said it operates at “arm’s length” from the government and “made the full decision” to award the contract to Accenture.\n",
            "Accenture declined to comment on the agreement.\n",
            "Although Accenture is widely known as one of the largest management-consulting companies in the world, both the Finance Department and EDC said the company provided technology and staffing services, “not consultant advice.”\n",
            "The contract has never been included in the government’s proactive-disclosure database, nor in lists tabled in Parliament of contracts awarded during the pandemic.\n",
            "After The Globe’s reporting earlier this year, parliamentarians in opposition parties filed requests to the government for more information about the contract.\n",
            "According to documents filed in the House and the Senate, the agreement with Accenture actually comprises a total of 31 contracts to deliver CEBA, some of which were extensions of earlier agreements. The earliest was for $1-million on April 8, 2020, to set up a program to connect Ottawa with 230 financial institutions, as businesses applied for the CEBA loans through their banks or credit unions.\n",
            "The most recent contract on the list was for $4,976,050, on Feb. 1, to continue funding the CEBA call centre and prepare it for collecting the loans. Businesses that pay back their CEBA loans by Dec. 31 get part of the loans forgiven. The final deadline to pay them back in full is Dec. 31, 2025.\n",
            "The total value of all CEBA contracts awarded to Accenture is $208-million, and they run until February, 2024, according to the documents.\n",
            "That is larger than any other contract given to a major consulting firm in Ottawa’s public database of contracts. The next biggest is a $203-million, multiyear, competitive contract awarded to Deloitte to modernize the Old Age Security payment system. The largest previously awarded to Accenture was a $130-million, six-year, competitive contract it was given in 2016 for management consulting for Public Services and Procurement Canada.\n",
            "Opposition politicians expressed frustration with how difficult it has been to get information about the contract.\n",
            "“The government has been clear as mud on this file,” said Conservative Senator Yonah Martin. “Nothing was done proactively, and still to this day we aren’t getting the full story.”\n",
            "NDP MP Gord Johns said he understands the explanation for the sole-source contract, but he believes the government should have found a way to eventually bring the program into the public service rather than rely on outside contractors for years.\n",
            "“It certainly demonstrates the lack of capacity and ability to pivot within the federal government,” he said.\n",
            "The Finance Department said Accenture currently has 129 employees working on CEBA. Four are based in the United States, and the rest are in Canada. EDC said it has 15 staff working on the program.\n",

            "NEW YORK & SUNNYVALE, Calif.- Through a strategic expansion of their relationship, Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Google Cloud will help organizations reinvent their businesses with generative AI to unlock new growth opportunities, supported by substantial new investments by Accenture.\n",
            "Today’s expansion builds on Accenture’s recently announced $3 billion investment in AI . Together, Accenture and Google Cloud will help organizations use generative AI to create new opportunities to drive next-level innovation, optimization and reinvention. Building on the combination of capabilities and talent within the Accenture Google Business Group and Google Cloud’s leading AI products (including Vertex AI, Generative AI App Builder and more), the companies will guide organizations on the optimal use of generative AI to address specific business needs securely, responsibly, and at scale.\n",
            "“Generative AI is already transforming how people work and access information and will dramatically amplify what humans can achieve,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. “Our expanded partnership with Google Cloud will help our clients across industries responsibly accelerate adoption of generative AI throughout their enterprises to maximize efficiency, drive competitive advantage, and reach new levels of performance.”\n",
            "“Generative AI has the ability to help businesses fundamentally improve how they operate, whether it is optimizing supply chains to be more sustainable or mitigating cybersecurity threats based on information from billions of security events,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. “Together with Accenture, we will provide businesses with the advanced technology and expertise they need to help transform their organizations and realize value from their generative AI deployments.”\n",
            "Under the expanded partnership, the companies will co-develop new solutions leveraging Accenture’s industry and functional experience and Google Cloud’s suite of generative AI technologies. The companies will focus on improving business processes across 19 industries and six business functions, with a strategic focus on sales and marketing, supply chain, healthcare, retail and consumer packaged goods, financial services, sustainability, security, and operational services. Examples include:\n",
            "Tailored marketing and customer experiences : The two companies will use generative AI to help businesses create hyper-personalized advertisements and digital content, deliver customized dynamic pricing, and reinvent their interactions with their end consumers. Supply chain optimization : Accenture and Google Cloud will use generative AI to help customers predict optimal inventory levels to minimize storage costs, improve shipping routes to reduce gas consumption, and anticipate delivery dates and delays to increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, Accenture will expand the supply chain functionality in its retail solution, which is now using Google Cloud’s large language models (LLMs) to help businesses optimize their customer, workforce, and storefront experiences. Healthcare process improvement : Accenture will use a variety of Google’s LLMs, tuned to health care, to develop solutions to help improve operational efficiency, caregiver support, patient engagement, and research and development. Accenture is also addressing critical healthcare challenges with Google Cloud’s technologies and using the AI-enabled Claims Acceleration Suite to streamline health insurance and prior authorization claims processing by transforming data, enabling clinicians to make faster, more informed decisions. Security risk mitigation : The Accenture Adaptive Detection and Response Service was the first to use Google Cloud’s specialized security LLM, Sec-PaLM, which is trained on billions of cybersecurity data signals and helps customers protect critical assets and stay ahead of cyber threats. The service also includes Google Cloud’s Chronicle Security Operations technology, enabling businesses to mitigate cybersecurity incidents in real-time, such as malware, phishing, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and trends that may indicate a security breach. Software code generation : Accenture is working with Google Cloud's Foundational Model for code, Codey, to complement Accenture’s existing software engineering capabilities. Codey helps accelerate software development for code generation, code chat, and code completion. To further extend its cybersecurity position, Lendlease, a global real estate group with core expertise in shaping cities and creating thriving communities, is using Accenture’s Adaptive Detection and Response service, built on Google Cloud technologies, to increase agility and allow it to simplify its security operations through greater transparency, flexibility and scale.\n",
            "“Having next-generation cybersecurity detection and response capabilities is critical for Lendlease to create connected communities and deliver workplaces of the future around the world,” said William Ruh, CEO, Lendlease Digital. “The Google Cloud generative AI technology within the Accenture service will allow us to optimize our security operations and infuse cyber resilience into the core of our business.”\n",
            "As part of the expanded partnership, a dedicated team of generative AI engineering experts from both companies will be aligned to Accenture Innovation Hubs in key locations around the world, including Bangalore, Dubai, Dublin, London, Melbourne, Milan, Munich, New York, Paris, San Francisco, São Paulo, Singapore, and Sydney. Leveraging the Accenture Center for Advanced AI, the hubs will host rapid experimentation and prototyping sessions to help clients unlock value from generative AI in days, rather than weeks or months.\n",
            "Accenture and Google Cloud are investing in a new integrated training curriculum to accelerate generative AI expertise within Accenture, scaling the resources available to businesses on their digital transformation journeys. The companies are also launching a joint AI Ambassador certification program that will provide specialized training in LLMs and building disruptive solutions. Accenture and Google Cloud's responsible AI practices will be at the core of this collaboration to help address bias, data protection and appropriate data use in order to create a foundation for trust.\n",
            "Beyond the partnership, Accenture is also using Google Cloud in its own enterprise architecture to enable its data-driven business. Accenture’s global IT organization partnered with Google Cloud to deploy a modern data platform for faster, more secure and scalable capabilities positioning Accenture for generative AI expansion.\n",
